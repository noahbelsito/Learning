# Learning Machine Learning
I have an extreme interest in the future of robots that have feelings.
Not the idea of looking like having emotions but the actual feeling.
The feeling you get when you lose someone you love. 
The feeling you get when you feel in love.
To feel. Not just to seem hurt.
A repo to watch my journey. Thanks for stopping by. ❤️
